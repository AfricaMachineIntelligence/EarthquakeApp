# EarthquakeApp
Earthquake app for predicting earthquakes, notifying people and gathering information about these events

This project aims to apply practically Dr. Freidmann Freund’s theory of earthquake sensory precursors. Dr. Freund's theory states that several hours prior to large earthquakes the Earth sends out intense energy bursts, detectable as electromagnetic fields, caused by the tectonic plate stressing the local crust. These EM field bursts consists of sudden local magnetic field fluctuations and a variety of atmospheric and ionospheric phenomena. This project aims to observe this phenomenon in historic and real time data, with the ultimate goal of observing a live anomalous EM field fluctuation and accurately forecasting an earthquake within a specified geographical range. 

This project analyses the magnetic field data collected in Alaska, the most seismically active region in the world. First, common magnetic signals are filtered through multi-signal noise canceling to enable observation of the baseline magnetic signal. Second, an anomaly detection algorithm is applied to the data, identifying abnormal points in the data that may be indicative of a pending earthquake. Then, an algorithm clusters the anomalous points, and then generates features statistically. Machine learning algorithms are fed the anomalous features extracted from historical data to build “Earthquake Sensory Precursors” that can be then used to forecast, in real time, future earthquakes.
